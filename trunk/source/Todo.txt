==================================================
Generic
==================================================
Optimizations
* Do a code analyst to see what takes most samples aka slowest code

==================================================
Client
==================================================
Cleanups
* Clean up register

Features
* Start rewrite the particle system 
  - Start rewrite the particle effects
* Change icon texture
* Add shadows from the player model
 
Particel Effect Features
* Explotion:
  - I skiped embers for now since they arent really necessary
* Blaster particles
  - Maybe it could be a bit more like q2xp
* CL_SmokePuffParticles
  - Maybe needs another smoke texture

* Instaid of calling 1000 cl_partilce cvars, find out a way to call it ONCE!  
* Maybe its possible but half-life 2 does this: For some particle like
explotion embers they remove and re-add them everytime a explotion happens so that they dont
stack up on each other, taking huge framerate.
* Doom 3 uses depthhack for some particles that makest them not cut on bsp
  - This would be a rendering flag, there is 3 steps for this and they are:
    - DEPTHHACK_RANGE_SHORT 
    - DEPTHHACK_RANGE_MID
    - DEPTHHACK_RANGE_LONG

Fixes
* Remove menu and make console the "mainmenu" for now
  - Seems that UI_SetActiveMenu is the function that activates menu on startup
* Fix brass origin with q2xp in muzzle flash code
  - This (i think) needs to be rewritten the origin
* The gravity on particles when you are lets say the flyer in vortex is fucked up
* Alpha spawning monsters in vortex doenst work, i cant see them'
  - This has to do with ent.flags and RF_ / EF_ flags in CL_AddPacketEntities 

==================================================
Renderer frontend
==================================================
Cleanups
* Finish clean up R_GfxInfo_f
* Rename all shader stuff to material

Optimizations
* Make the material parser abit faster by not setting the token in the function but
in the parser function it self

==================================================
Windows
==================================================
Features
* Would be cool to have a startup window like q2xp but with a texture

==================================================
Not sure
==================================================
Bugs
* p_auth map has a very wierd obilivion at the monsters start, wtf can this be?
* Find out why it never really connects to online servers like vortex;
you have to force it to connect
* set game "mod" doesnt change to the mod

Crashes
* I had a bad entityType in R_AddEntitiesToList on p_auth.
* Shadows crashed on shader = surface->shaders[entity->skinNum].shader;, on that map p_auth.
* The memory system fucking sucks, making the game crash because it cannot hunk more then X amount of memory!

==================================================
SVN Comments
==================================================

==================================================
Vortex Stand-alone game ideas
==================================================
* Support for Q3BSP
* GUI main menu 'easy-to-start-playing-menu'
* Ingame menus
  - Login/out
  - Classes, abilities etc
    - Show a "3D" model of the classes etc
* Better effects, replace any effect model with particles / localent effect
* Better netcode to avoid the "Net message overflow" when there is too many monsters on the map

// ===========================================================================

New material stage keywords
* surfType
* maskColor
* makeAlpha (TODO! (for lasers))
  
New in 0.2.0
* Material script system
* MD3 alias models
* Quake 3 style debug console
* Quake 3 .RoQ video format support
* Custom crosshair support
* New menu
* New particle effects
* Clipping decal effects on surfaces
* New console font with color
* New shell, brass (bullet, shell), powershield effects
* Better lighting on models; calculating on every vertex
* True 3D sound engine running through openAL, also uses some EAX extensions
* OGG Vorbis music playback

Wanted Features List
* Sound shaders
* 3D HUD models (scrible?)
* Material based blob shadows
* Q3BSP format
* GLSL with materials using a uniform structer
  - Refraction, reflection effects
* Particle editor
  - Edit the already existing function variables
* Decal editor
  - Edit the already existing function variables
* World surface sound, decal and particle effects via materials
* Simple shadows maps for models (like qfusion)
* Rattle effect (the camera shacks effect when a explotion happens for example)
* Scriptble GUI menu
* R1ch´s enchanced net protocol "35" and anticheat.dll
* EGL´s file and memory system
* !version and !renderer
* Better r_speeds; fps, ping and map time counter
* Better debug tools such as r_showtris
* Anti-aliasing for the edges of polygons  
* Move Client game stuff into its own dll? (cgame.dll)
  - help Paril säger:
     * (why EGL uses cgame.dll)
     * so he doesn't have to compile three or four of them
     * easier to have every game mode in one


Wanted Misc Feature List
* Better forum theme
* Site Wiki
* Better looking modDB
* Team name
* Local server (www.NAME.com, not a subdomain)

  discribing back-story, technologi wih screenshots.
* Features Page:
  - Needs tech engine features with a screenshos
* Tutorial Page:
  - Needs some .doc file about the material system, 
  particle design ideas, decal etc
