Client
* Replace all media with my own (textures, materials etc.) and clean it up
  - This needs some editing for the particle textures path of the material function (look at egl) or not
  - Finish replace all muzzle flash with new structer
* Clean up register
* Start rewrite the particle system
  - Start with the allocating 
    - This got problems with cl_particleMax
    - So move over to CL_AddParticle
      - Move alpha to color vec4_t
      - Add thinking functions
* Change icon
* Fix brass origin with q2xp in muzzle flash code
* Add shadows from the player model

Bugs
* The gravity on particles when you are lets say the flyer in vortex is fucked up
* p_auth map has a very wierd obilivion at the monsters start, wtf can this be?
* Find out why it never really connects to online servers like vortex;
you have to force it to connect
* Alpha spawning monsters in vortex doenst work, i cant see them'
  - This has to do with ent.flags and RF_ / EF_ flags in CL_AddPacketEntities
