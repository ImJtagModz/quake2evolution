Qauke 2 Evolution is a engine that aims to give the eye candy effects that most of the moddern games uses, such as a good particle system, decals, high-resolution textures and so on but still maintain good backend system such as memory, file system etc.

The engine will not break any backend compatiblities so you can still play online with who ever you want or whatever mod you want. In the feature, i hope to support anticheat.dll and R1chÂ´s net protocol "35".

If you want to make new hi-res content for quake like models and textures you can join the forums at the site link.
